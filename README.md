# Numerical Aspects References
> Just a bunch of references up to now. I use macOS 14.2 operative system, but many commands can be easily used in Linux with slightly changes. 

Here I collect useful guides to set up the working environment for the [Numerical Aspects course](https://github.com/paolofinelli)

## Setting up the terminal with iTerm2

This is a non-necessary section to install and setup iTerm2 in macOS. There's no difference with the built-in terminal, but the graphics is more a more satisfactory.

### References

Have a look at these links to install and configure iTerm 2:

- [Beautify your iTerm2 and prompt](https://medium.com/airfrance-klm/beautify-your-iterm2-and-prompt-40f148761a49)


If you mess something up with the `.zshrc` file, the following guide may be useful
- [How do I reset and put the zshrc file back to default?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45112197/how-do-i-reset-and-put-the-zshrc-file-back-to-default)

```shell
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
```


To set up and understand what `zplug` is, first, install it with

```shell
brew install zplug
```

and then have a look at the documentation:
